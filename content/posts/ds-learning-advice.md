To become a data scientist advice: Focus on Python (including Numpy, Pandas, and Jupyter notebooks).

* Try to focus on 1 main project. Extend something that you did in class. It can be difficult if you are mostly doing scattered problem sets in a variety of areas. For self-learners, one of the risks is jumping around too much and starting scattered tutorials across a range of sites, but never going deep enough with any one thing. Pick 1 Kaggle competition, personal project, or extension of a school project and stick with it. I can think of a few times I continued extended a class project for months after the class ended, because I was so absorbed in it. This is a great way to learn.
* Start with decision tree ensembles (random forests and gradient boosting machines) on structured data sets. I have deeply conflicted feelings on this topic. While it’s possible to do these in Python using sklearn, I think R still handles structured datasets and categorical variables better. However, if you are only going to master one language, I think Python is the clear choice, and most people can’t focus on learning 2 new languages at the same time.
* Then move on to deep learning using the Python library [Keras](https://www.fast.ai/2017/01/03/keras/). To quote Andrew Ng, deep learning is [“the new electricity”](https://www.fast.ai/2016/10/11/fortune/) and a very exciting, high impact area to be working in.

Becoming ready for a move to data science

1. Most importantly: find ways to work whatever you want to learn into your current job. Find a project that involves more coding/data analysis and that would be helpful to your employer. Take any boring task you do and try to automate it. Even if the process of automation makes it take 5x as long (and even if you only do the task once!), you are learning by doing this.
2. Analyze any data you have: from research for an upcoming purchase (i.e. deciding which microwave to buy), data from a personal fitness tracker, nutrition data from recipes you’re cooking, pre-schools you’re looking at for your child. Turn it into a mini-data analysis project and write it up in a blog post. E.g. if you are a graduate student, you could analyze grade data from the students you are teaching
3. Learn the most important data science software tools: Python’s data science stack (pandas/numpy/scipy) is the #1 most useful technology to learn (read [this book](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920050896.do)!), followed closely by SQL. I would focus on getting very comfortable with Python and SQL before learning other languages. Python is widely used and flexible. You will be well-positioned if you decide to switch to more software development work or to go full-steam into machine learning.
4. Use [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). Do the tutorials, participate in the forums, enter a competition (don’t worry about where you place - just focus on doing a little better every day). It’s the best way to learn practical machine skills.
5. Search for data science and tech meetups in your area. With the explosion of data science in the last few years, there are now meetups in countries all over the world and in a wide variety of cities. For instance, Google recently held a [TensorFlow Dev Summit](https://events.withgoogle.com/tensorflow-dev-summit/) in Mountain View, CA, but there were viewing parties around the world that watched the livestream together ([including in Abuja, Nigeria](https://twitter.com/jennifazor/status/831922571469869057), [Coimbatore, India](https://twitter.com/GDGCoimbatore/status/832231191042367488), and [Rabat, Morocco](https://twitter.com/GDGRabat/status/831913259028643841)).

## Online courses

Online courses are an amazing resource. You can learn from the world’s best data scientists in the comfort of your own home. Often the assignments are where most of the learning occurs, so don’t skip them! Here’s a few of my favorites:

* Andrew Ng’s classic [machine learning Coursera class](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) (He does a great job explaining the algorithms, although don’t spend too much time on Octave/MATLAB. It’s probably better to do the assignments in Python, [like this](http://www.johnwittenauer.net/machine-learning-exercises-in-python-part-1/).)
* The fast.ai [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](http://course.fast.ai/) course. Disclosure: I helped create this course, and we’ve gotten lots of [positive feedback](http://course.fast.ai/testimonials.html) from students. The only prerequisite is 1 year of coding experience.
* Udacity’s [data science sequence](https://www.udacity.com/courses/data-science).
* Udacity’s [Web Development Course](https://www.udacity.com/course/web-development--cs253). Technically you don’t need to know this to be a data scientist, but [becoming a better software developer makes you a better data scientist](https://quomodocumque.wordpress.com/2017/02/26/mathematicians-becoming-data-scientists-should-you-how-to/), and it is so useful to know how to build your own web apps.

As one of the questioners highlighted above, the amount of information, tutorials, and courses available online can be overwhelming. One of the biggest risks is jumping from thing to thing, without ever completing one or sticking with a topic long enough to learn it. It’s important to find a course or project that is “good enough”, and then stick with it. Something that can be helpful with this is finding or _starting a meet-up group_ to work through an online course together.

Online courses are very useful for the knowledge you gain (and it’s so important that you do all the assignments, as that is how you learn). However, I have not seen any benefit to getting the certificates from them (yet– I know this is a newer area of growth). This is based on my experience as having interviewed a ton of job applicants when hiring data scientists, and having interviewed for many positions myself.

## News sources

* Twitter can be a surprisingly helpful way to find interesting articles and opportunities. For instance, my collaborator Jeremy Howard has provided over 1,000 links to his favorite [machine learning papers and blog posts](https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward/likes) (NB: you’ll need to be signed in to Twitter to read this link). It will take some time to figure out who to follow (and may involve some following and unfollowing and searching along the way), although one short cut is to look at who wrote the tweets you like in the link above, and follow them directly. Look up data scientists at companies that interest you. Look up the authors of libraries and tools that you use, or are interested in. When you find a tutorial or blog post you like, look up the author. And then look up who these people retweet. If you are unsure what or how to tweet, I think it can be helpful to think of Twitter as a way to (publicly) bookmark links that you like. I try to tweet any article or tutorial that I think I may want to reference back to in a few months time.
* The [machine learning subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/) is a great source of recent news. You may find a lot of it inaccessible at first, but after a couple of months you’ll start seeing more and more that you recognize
* It’s helpful to sign up for newsletters such as [Import AI newsletter](http://us13.campaign-archive1.com/home/?u=67bd06787e84d73db24fb0aa5&id=6c9d98ff2c) and [WildML news](http://www.wildml.com/newsletter/)
