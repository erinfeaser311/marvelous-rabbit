This week I'm going to be focus on going on a deep-dive of Kaggle Micro-courses--I just completed their Intro to Machine Learning Course and it was really great. I loved how quick and practical it was. My biggest hang-up with online courses in the DS / ML world is that so much of the time you spend on either theory or "projects" that aren't applicable in the real world or on the job. I can tell you the amount of times at my job I've had to analyze app ratings is pretty much nada. So here are my goals for this week and then for this month. I'm also including some additional courses not related to DS / ML I'll be taking this month, because well I have other interests too, duh.
