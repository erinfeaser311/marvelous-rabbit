Hey all you cool cats and kittens!

This week I'm going to be focusing on going on a deep-dive of Kaggle Micro-courses--I just completed their Intro to Machine Learning Course and it was really great. I loved how quick and practical it was. My biggest hang-up with online courses in the DS / ML world is that so much of the time you spend on either theory or "projects" that aren't applicable in the real world or on the job. I can tell you the amount of times at my job I've had to analyze app ratings or look at Star Wars survey data is pretty much zippo. So here are my goals for this week and then for this month. I'm also including a course not related to DS / ML I'll be taking this month, because I have other interests too, duh.

## This Week

1. Kaggle's [Intermediate Machine Learning Course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intermediate-machine-learning)
2. Kaggle's [Deep Learning Course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/deep-learning)
3. Kaggle's [Game AI and Reinforcement Learning Course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-game-ai-and-reinforcement-learning)
4. Kaggle's[ Pandas Course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas) (as a refresher)
5. Kaggle's [Feature Engineering Course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/feature-engineering)
6. Kaggle's [Machine Learning Explainability Course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/machine-learning-explainability)

## This Month (April)

1. Real Python's [Functional Programming Course](https://realpython.com/courses/functional-programming-python/)
2. Real Python's Publishing a Python Package Course
3. Complete up to Step 4 in DataQuest's Data Scientist in Python track
4. Complete Google's Machine Learning Crash Course
5. Complete Google's Clustering Course
6. Complete Google's Recommendation System's Course

A secondary interest of mine is personal finance and investing (my second major in college) so I'd like to also complete this online course on [Asset Allocation](https://www.theinvestorspodcast.com/asset-allocation-video-course/) because I'm starting to build a portfolio outside of my 401k and Roth IRA and just feel like I could use a good refresh.

I'll be updating this post throughout the week with edits when I accomplish something, and then at the end of the week with the week's successes / missteps / potential improvements!
