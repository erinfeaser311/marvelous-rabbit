* Show a budget of how much you can make coming out of college and how much you can afford to go to student loan debt
* Show visualization of interest compounding
* Maybe make a tool that shows average entry salary with your major in where you are going to school (allow selection of other location)--show tuition costs + room and board, interest, and how much you will have to pay back at the end with a typical budget. Show how many years you can be in debt. Then show other scenarios--if you are paying this student debt, how long it will take to buy a house, pay for a wedding, a vacation, a new car you can afford
* Maybe make this into some sort of tool?
