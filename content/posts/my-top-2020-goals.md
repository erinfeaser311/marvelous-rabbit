When I sat down to write out my goals for the new year at the end of December last year, I ended up with a word document with over 40 items. Yikes. I knew there was no way it was humanly feasible to complete all those items in one year, so I tried to scale it back. I got to 32 items. I thought "well, maybe if I bucket some under a topic that'll help narrow it down." It did--I got to about 25 goals. At this point I called it quits--"Well, I guess I'm completing 25 goals this year." Fast forward a month and a half, and I sat down on the couch with my husband, and told him that I felt just completely overwhelmed. This lofty goal list was always looming over me. Even when I was sitting on the toilet I was thinking "how should I be better utilizing my time so I can reach my goals." I told him I just felt completely overwhelmed, that there was so much to do, and I basically was accomplishing nothing because I spent all of my time feeling simultaneously overwhelmed while also unorganized, and then spending all my free time organizing how I was going to complete my goals. Ugh.

> You need to pick three. Pick three things to focus on, and get them done. Then move on to the next thing. One at a time.

That's what my husband told me. I said "But I want to do MORE than just three things!" But the truth is--I'm not accomplishing even one thing. I realized a brutal truth. I can't do everything I want. Not at one time. So here I am, accepting it. So I'm making this post about the 8 things that will receive my attention this year. 8 is more than 3, but not more than three at a time. So here they are. I'll update my progress on a monthly basis. I WILL complete these.
