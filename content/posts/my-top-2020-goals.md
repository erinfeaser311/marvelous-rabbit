When I sat down to write out my goals for the new year at the end of December last year, I ended up with a word document with over 40 items. Yikes. I knew there was no way it was humanly feasible to complete all those items in one year, so I tried to scale it back. I got to 32 items. I thought "well, maybe if I bucket some under a topic that'll help narrow it down." It did--I got to about 25 goals. At this point I called it quits--"Well, I guess I'm completing 25 goals this year." Fast forward a month and a half, and I sat down on the couch with my husband, and told him that I felt just completely overwhelmed. This lofty goal list was always looming over me. Even when I was sitting on the toilet I was thinking "how should I be better utilizing my time so I can reach my goals." I told him I just felt completely overwhelmed, that there was so much to do, and I basically was accomplishing nothing because I spent all of my time feeling simultaneously overwhelmed while also unorganized, and then spending all my free time organizing how I was going to complete my goals. Ugh.

> You need to pick three. Pick three things to focus on, and get them done. Then move on to the next thing. One at a time.

That's what my husband told me. I said "But I want to do MORE than just three things!" But the truth is--I'm not accomplishing even one thing. I realized a brutal truth. I can't do everything I want. Not at one time. So here I am, accepting it. So I'm making this post about the 8 things that will receive my attention this year. 8 is more than 3, but not more than three at a time. So here they are. I'll update my progress on a monthly basis. I WILL complete these.

## Get fit (again) and get to 115 lbs

So after I had my baby within 10 days or so I was pretty much back at my pre-pregnancy weight--about 117 pounds. However, you have to wait 6 weeks to do any type of light exercise, and even longer for more intense workouts. Breastfeeding requires you to eat more, and you aren't sleeping and barely have time to cook good meals. Going back to work has been hard with figuring out a schedule, so working out has fallen to the backburner. Breastfeeding and eating alot has continued, so I've actually GAINED weight in the past 7 months. I'm up to about 127, which is how much I weighed at about 25 weeks pregnant. Crazy. I'm so flabby and it's driving me crazy, so this is my main goal. It's going to be hard since I would like to breastfeed my daughter until she is 1, so eating more calories unfortunately just comes with the territory, but now that she is older, mostly sleeps through the night, and we are starting to find our groove in life and work I feel confident I can work out a schedule to get back to working out regularly and drop this weight I've gained. So here is my plan:

* 10 minute abs 5 out of 7 days of the week. I'd love to say EVERY day but life happens and sometimes I honestly am just too tired (and sorry to all those "suck it up even if you are practically dying" folks, but sometimes you really are just TOO tired, esp. if you are a new working parent). I'll use the app HabitShare to keep track of this, and I'll post a screenshot of it during my monthly updates to keep accountable.
* A regular weight-lifting workout 3 days of the week, for 45 minutes, until I finish breastfeeding.
* Once I stop (or significantly decrease the number of times a day) breastfeeding, I'll add in an extra workout, and try to do 2 days of HIIT workouts and 2 days of regular weight-lifting. I'll track this through the JEFIT app (which I love) and post screenshots once a month as well.

## Get a cloud certification

I'm going to take the AWS Developer and AWS Big Data certification no matter what. If I don't pass those exams I'm going to take an Azure exam (AI Engineer, Data Engineer, Data Scientist, Infrastructure). This is an back half of the year goal.

To study for the AWS Developer exam I am going to complete this [tutorial](https://serverless-stack.com/ "tutorial") and read through notes I've already taken.

To study for the AWS Big Data exam I'm going to take two weeks and go through my notes and a study plan I've identified online.

I'll take anyone's suggestions for an Azure (heck even GCP) cloud certification--whichever is best for a Data Scientist wannabe Data Engineer to take!

## Start business - earn $2k

My husband and I are developing a business idea with a really cool product idea my husband had. More on this later!

## Get accepted into a Master's program

I applied to Georiga Tech and UT. Hopefully I hear back from one of them! Goal already (mostly) completed. Just have to get accepted!

## Complete my Trello learning track

Found [here](https://trello.com/b/k8sgSuRr/machine-learning-courses-progress "here")! Here is my plan:

 1. The Python Tutorial
 2. Google's Machine Learning Crash Course
 3. Google's Data Prep and ML Crash Course
 4. Google's Clustering Course
 5. Google's Testing and Debugging in ML Course
 6. Google's Recommendation Systems Course
 7. fast.ai - ML course
 8. fast.ai - Deep Learning course
 9. Python for Entrepreneurs
10. (Maybe) deeplearning.ai's Deep Learning Specialization course

DataQuest:

1. Data Scientist path
2. Data Engineering path

Kaggle:

1. Enter one competition
2. Potentially complete their micro-challenges (if I feel like Dataquest ain't doing it for me)

Math:

[https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning "https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning")

GCP:

Practice Programming Skillz - [https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/foundational/](https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/foundational/ "https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/foundational/")

DS - [https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/machine-learning/](https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/machine-learning/ "https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/machine-learning/")

GCP - DS in the Cloud - [https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/cloud/sequence-3/](https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/cloud/sequence-3/gcp-products-described-in-4-words-or-less/# "https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/cloud/sequence-3/gcp-products-described-in-4-words-or-less/#")

Next year: Scala, Go, JavaScript (and Tensorflow.js)

The above needs refined. I'll be refining it in the days to come!

## Start blogging

That's what this site is all about! :D I'm going to just do it instead of having some crazy strategy. I'll try to blog twice a week to start, and see how it goes from there. I'm going to post on this site, but if I write a strictly DS topic I'm also going to try to post on Dev.to and Medium (TDS). I'm going to try to write one blog a week about my learning progress, monthly about this goal process as well.

## Create a DS course

Another back end of the year goal. I'd like to either create a course on a very niche topic within Data Science or on a topic I really dived more into / found interesting / had a hard time understanding throughout my learning track (above). I'm going to use this [repo](https://github.com/ines/course-starter-python "repo") to build the course and make it available for free.

## Host 8 PyLadies Meetups

I am committed to growing this Meetup--here are some of the idea for Meetups I'd like to have this year:

 1. Interactive Data Visualization with Bokeh
 2. Data Analysis w/ Spreadsheets & Python
 3. Mix & Mingle with Local Software Engineers / Devs
 4. Intro to Django
 5. Demystifying Data Structures (in Python)
 6. Intro to Web Scraping With Python
 7. Python Ladiesâ€™ Nights
 8. Hack night/hack weekend
 9. Sprinting on an Open Source project (e.g. Django, CPython, etc)
10. Study group
11. Coffee & hack
12. Speaker series/lightning talks

If you are in the Harrisburg area and interested, you can join our group [here](https://www.meetup.com/PyLadies-Central-PA/ "here")! I'd love to grow this group into 15-20 regular attending members by the end of the year!

### P.S. Finding the best budgeting / wealth tracking tool possible

Whether that means building it myself (spreadsheet + dashboarding tool), using something spreadsheet-related like Tiller Money, or a budgeting software like YNAB.
