**Welcome!** My name is Erin Feaser and I am a Data Scientist and That Crazy Data Lady. I am also a wife and a mother to the sweetest little girl named Selene.

I graduated from Shippensburg University in 2018 with dual degrees in Information Systems and Finance, with a minor in Data Science. Since then I've been working as a developer, RPA Engineer, and most recently a Data Scientist at a  regional supermarket chain.

I'm using this blog to document my journey over 2020 (and potentially beyond) into the finer points of data science, more specifically machine learning and deep learning. Yay! I'll leave you with one of my favorite quotes--

> I don't know what I'm doing but I know I'm doing it really, really well. <cite>Any Dwyer</cite>
